Hello, my name is TRAN Nam-Mai, a junior developer whose initial background is Economics, now converting step by step to the data science world. In order to prepare for that, I have been pursuing two advanced degrees in data science: a Msc in Statistics and a MBA in Big Data Analytics where I can acquire neccessary statistics knowledge, programming skills and business acumen.
